  Core Deliverables
  1. Write a preamble that lets the browser know that this document's type is HTML.
  2. Write a <head> and <body>.
  3. Link this file to `index.js`, so that the browser loads that file **after** loading the <body>.

<!-- This is a comment tag, also executable by shortcut "CMD + /" -->
<!-- <head></head> are nonvisual elements: does not show up on the page-->
<head>
  <meta lang="en" />
  <title>My Website!</title>
  <!-- defer runs HTML before the javascript-->
